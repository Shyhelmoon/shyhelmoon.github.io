            The Vertigo Protocol is a Boomer Shooter style game, cast in the image of antecedents such as Doom, Quake, Boltgun, Ultrakill, and other superb titles. The player challenges the might of the Tower oF Babel, 
            using various movement techniques and weapons to fight enemies and navigate the vertical environments in their climb. Composed of several levels, players will be able to upgrade skills and weapons
            over time, unlike typical boomer shooter games, allowing for an increased level of customizability for the players in how they approach the game's challenges. Platforming and mobile combat are highly
            emphasized and rewarded, encouraging the player to take advantage of the game's various movement styles as the player develops their own personal gameplay style and refines their choices through
            skill trees.

            As the player progresses through the game, they will be confronted with several types of enemies, ranging from more realistic shooter type enemies one might expect in a modern setting, to fantastic
            creatures more likely seen in fantasy, until finally the final floor of the tower sees the player confront the divine itself. As is traditional in Boomer Shooter style games, there will be very few
            npcs for the player to communicate with, and the story itself will mostly be expressed through examination of the environment rather than a more cinematic narrative. This allows players more interested
            in the gameplay to immerse themselves fully, while allowing story driven players to explore and uncover mysteries. Furthermore, this calls back to the traditional roots of the Boomer Shooter genre, providing
            a comfortable environment for players that are interested in games which remind them of the classics.
